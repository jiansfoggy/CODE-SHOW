For PostgreSQL, I insert 1000 Users, 25 Recipes and 50000 Orders.

And we are required to query by recipe Id in non-indexed and indexed situation. 
There are 25 different pizza recipes, so the order table is queried 25 times for different recipes each time.

In Nonindexed one, we can see the cost, rows and width for each query.

And for each query, the start cost is 0.0, the total cost is 820.79.

In Indexed one, we can see the cost, rows and width for each query.

And for Heap Scan on orders in each query, the start cost is from 9.68 to 88.17, the total cost is from 299.35 to 418.26.

For Index Scan on index_rec, the start cost is 0.0, the maximum total cost is 87.65, which is much lower than that from Nonindexed one, which is 820.79.

Therefore, indexing Recipes_Name will significantly reduce the cost and improve the database's performance.
