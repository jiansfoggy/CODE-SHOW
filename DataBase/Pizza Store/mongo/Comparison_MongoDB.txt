For MongoDB, I also insert 1000 users, 25 recipes, 50000 orders into different collections. For both nonindexed and indexed situation, I query 25 times for each recipe.

Before adding an index on recipe ID, it takes around 23-54 ms to process. The average execution time is 48.36 ms.

Next, I add index by 

> db.Order.ensureIndex(
{ Recipes_Name : 1 },
{ unique : true, dropDups : true }
)

As we can see, the index in mongodb significantly shrinks the processing time. The processing time is reduced to 46-57 ms after adding index. The average execution time is 49.32 ms.

It is very weird, since that the execution time should be greatly shrink after adding index. However, it does not show like I thought.
But this result is much better than PostgreSQL.
